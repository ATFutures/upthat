# Introduction

This is the user manual of the Urban Health Impact Assessment Tool (upthat).
It focusses on using the tool via an interactive web application, currently hosted at https://atfutures.github.io/uta/.
For more advanced documentation, see the scenarios report and the adaptation manual.

# User interface

The user interface (UI) shown below has four main components:

- Interactive map: this allows the user to zoom, pan and even tilt the city, using controls that are documented in the `mapdeck` R package [@R-mapdeck]
- City: this is used for changing cities
- Scenarios: this dropdown menu allows users to choose from a range of pre-specified scenarios
- Mode: selecting different modes from this dropdown menu reveals estimated flows of that mode on the road network

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1825120/69012592-604e8580-096f-11ea-9140-1a646e164741.png")
```

# Outputs

The two main outputs of the tool, for a given scenario, are:

1. Estimates of where active transport levels are likely to be highest
2. Estimates of the health impacts of different scenarios (work in progress)

# Running upthat locally

Upthat is a fully open and reproducible web application.
You can reproduce it on your computer on a local installation of R as follows:

```{r repro, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("atfutures/upthat")
library(upthat)
upthat::runUpthat()
```
